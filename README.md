⚡ Multi-Language Matching Engine
This project is a high-performance trading system that simulates the internal operations of a modern financial exchange. It processes buy and sell orders in real-time using a powerful hybrid stack of C++, Python, and JavaScript.
Each component is written in the language best suited for its role:

C++ handles all performance-critical logic, including the matching algorithm, trade persistence, and authentication.
Python acts as a WebSocket bridge between the backend and frontend, enabling real-time data streaming.JavaScript and HTML provide a clean, interactive web interface for users to submit and monitor orders. The primary goal is to demonstrate how multiple languages can form a cohesive architecture that achieves both high speed and user interactivity. This project makes the complex reality of financial trading systems accessible and educational.


🧠 System Overview
The system uses a three-layer architecture: a frontend, a WebSocket bridge, and a C++ backend. The frontend is the user's entry point, with a simple form for placing buy or sell orders with specific prices, quantities, and advanced options.
The Python layer, built with FastAPI and asyncio, serves as the communication hub. It manages client connections, validates incoming order formats, and relays them to the C++ engine. When the engine processes an order, this layer broadcasts the results (like trade confirmations and order book updates) back to all connected clients.
The C++ Core Matching Engine is the computational heart of the system. It maintains the bid and ask books (active buy and sell orders). New orders are matched based on strict price-time priority—better prices and earlier orders are executed first. The entire cycle, from user input to confirmation, completes in milliseconds.

⚙️ Core Functionality
C++ Core Engine
The C++ core is a high-speed engine that processes all incoming orders and manages the order book. When a buy and a sell order are compatible, a trade is generated and executed. All trades are logged via logger.hpp, and state changes are saved by the persistence.hpp module, ensuring data integrity. The core also includes a C++ authentication mechanism to verify user identity before trading.
Python WebSocket Server
The Python server handles all communication between the C++ backend and clients. It receives JSON-encoded orders, forwards them to the engine, and pushes responses back instantly. Built with FastAPI and asyncio, it handles many concurrent connections without blocking, making the system scalable.

Frontend Dashboard
The HTML and JavaScript dashboard provides a simple, dynamic interface. It connects to the WebSocket endpoint automatically, allowing users to submit orders, view live trades, and see real-time bid/ask updates. Every change in the order book is reflected instantly.

⚡ Performance and Design Philosophy
This system is built for low-latency, high-reliability processing. The C++ engine's modular design allows components like the order book, logger, and persistence to be developed or replaced independently.

By combining three languages, this project achieves the best of all worlds: the raw speed of C++, the flexibility of Python, and the accessibility of JavaScript. This architecture mirrors real-world trading systems where backend performance and frontend responsiveness are equally critical.

🧠 Future Vision
The future roadmap includes:

Expanding to a fully distributed, multi-threaded environment.

Integrating a persistent database for storage.

Adding graphical market analytics to the frontend.

Introducing advanced order types (e.g., Iceberg, Trailing Stop).

Evolving the Python layer into a hybrid REST + WebSocket API.

📈 Usage
1. Frontend Dashboard
The index.html dashboard provides an interactive interface for placing orders and monitoring market data.




.

BBO (Best Bid Offer): Displays the current best buy and sell prices.

Place Order: Allows users to select buy/sell, input price and quantity, then submit.

Recent Trades: Shows a live feed of executed trades, indicating buy/sell side, quantity, and price.

2. Python WebSocket Server Logs
The Python server logs provide real-time feedback on received orders and HTTP requests, confirming successful order submissions.




.

Each log entry includes the order details (ID, symbol, side, type, price, quantity) and the HTTP status.

3. API Submission (e.g., using Postman)
Orders can also be submitted directly via API endpoints, typically using a tool like Postman. This demonstrates the system's flexibility for programmatic interaction.




.

The image shows a JSON payload for a BUY order being submitted, with a successful 200 OK response including the confirmed order details.
